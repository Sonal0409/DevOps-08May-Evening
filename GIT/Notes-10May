If some files are not required to be tracked by GIT --> ignore certain files for version control

=================================================

Git provides the concept of .gitignore, where in we create a file with the name .gitignore
And we will add names of the files that we dont want to track
This concept is applicable to files which are new and untracked

# vim .gitignore

In this file insert the name of files to be ingores

press i

*.xml
*.php
*.log

:wq

# git status

This concept this applicable to new file(files that are not commited)
It is only for untracked file.


8. How can GIT  ignore changes on tracked files for certian time.

GIT STASHING

============================================

If we have some incomplete work on tracked files, we can stash them in a temporary location and latter we can get them back to working directory

vim index1.html

press i

inster some new data

press esc key
:wq   and then enter key

# git status ==> you will see modiffied file

# git diff index1.html

Stash the modifications

# git stash

you can see the stash in .git==>refs==>stash folder

# git stash list

stash is saved a n array of index

stash name stash@{0}

see what saved in the stash 

# git show stash@{0}

================================================

19-Apr Notes
================================================

# sudo su -

# cd myproject

1. Check the log for commit history

# git log

in this HEAD it is an object in git which represents the latest/recent commit id

# git log --oneline

Check commit history of every commit in a single line

# git show <commid id>
Shows what happened in that commit.

See commits of a particular file:

 git log --graph --all -- index1.html


2. Create a feature branch in git  and switch to the branch

========================================

# git branch

Create a new branch

# git branch feature1

Switch to the new branch

# git checkout feature1

[OR]

Create a new branch and switch to the branch also

# git checkout -b feature2

3. Merge the commits/files of new branch to master

Before merging always switch to the destination branch

# git checkout master

# git merge feature1 master

< git merge sourcebranch destinationbranch>


4. Delete a branch which is not merged with master branch

# git branch -D <branchname>

Delete a branch whose commits have been merged with the master branch

# git branch -d feature1
