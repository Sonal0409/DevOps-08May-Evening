Difference between Docker and Kubernetes
=================================================
> Docker is tool where we write docker file and build Custom Image
> Provide Images in a Public or private registry
> In docker creation of 1 container from 1 image:v1
> Docker worked with single docker host

Container Orchestration Tool -> Kubernetes

> Creating multiple containers(replicas) from single image
> Works in Cluster mode ( mulitple VMs where docker is installed)
> Distributes the replicas to various VM thata re part of the cluster
> Desire number of container are always maintained in kubernetes(High availabiltiy)
> Scale up and scale down the containers (manually , autoScaling)
> Rolling update Deployment
> Kubernetes can orchestrate container of other CRI also- docker or CRI-O, containerD
